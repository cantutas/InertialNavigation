# Signal search and acquisition algorithm
This Program achieves the capture of signals from GPS satellites with a spreading code number of PRN8. The GPS data has a sampling frequency of fs = 25 MHz and a carrier frequency of fIF = 6.25 MHz. The program can perform two-dimensional searches for target satellite signals in the dimensions of code phase and Doppler frequency and plot the results in a three-dimensional graph, where the X-axis and Y-axis represent Doppler frequency shift (in Hz) and code phase (in chips), respectively, and the Z-axis shows the correlation values for each search cell.
